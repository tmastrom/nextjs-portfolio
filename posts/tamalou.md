There's a card game I like to play called "Tamalou". I didn't always have a pen and paper handy and I found keeping score in my notes app clunky, so I created a simple app to keep track of the score.

I used NextJS with MaterialUI components and deployed the app using Vercel to [tamaloo.vercel.app/](https://tamaloo.vercel.app/). <br>


Thanks for looking
